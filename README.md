1) SCRAPING DATA

#IMPORTING WANTED MODULES
1.from selenium import webdriver
Purpose: This imports the webdriver module from the selenium package.
Usage: It allows you to control a web browser programmatically. You can open a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.), navigate to websites, and interact with the pages.

2. from selenium.webdriver import ActionChains
Purpose: This imports ActionChains, a class in Selenium that allows you to simulate complex user interactions with the browser.
Usage: You can use ActionChains to perform actions like mouse movements, clicks, key presses, and drag-and-drop operations.

3. from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
Purpose: The By class helps you locate elements on the web page by various methods.
Usage: You can use By to find elements by ID, class name, tag name, XPath, CSS selector, etc.

4. from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
Purpose: This imports the Keys class from selenium.webdriver.common.keys.
Usage: It is used to simulate key presses (e.g., ENTER, ESC, TAB, etc.). For example, sending a Keys.RETURN to submit a form.

5. from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException, NoSuchElementException
Purpose: This imports exceptions that can be raised by Selenium during the execution of your script.
TimeoutException: Raised when an element could not be found in the allotted time (often used with waits).
NoSuchElementException: Raised when an element cannot be located on the page.
Usage: You use these exceptions to handle errors when elements take too long to load or do not exist.

6. import time
Purpose: This imports the time module from Python's standard library.
Usage: You can use it to introduce delays in your script with time.sleep(seconds), which is useful for waiting for elements to load or perform actions slowly in between interactions.

7. import pandas as pd
Purpose: This imports the pandas library as pd. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
Usage: You can use Pandas to work with structured data (e.g., CSV files, data frames). In web scraping, itâ€™s often used to store scraped data in a structured tabular format.
8. from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
Purpose: This imports the WebDriverWait class from selenium.webdriver.support.ui.
Usage: It allows you to wait for certain conditions to be true before continuing the execution of the script. For example, waiting for an element to become visible or clickable before interacting with it.
9. from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
Purpose: This imports expected_conditions, often referred to as EC.
Usage: This module contains conditions that can be used with WebDriverWait to wait for certain events or conditions. For example, you can wait for an element to be present in the DOM, visible, or clickable.

Summary
In short, this script imports various modules to:
Open and control a web browser with Selenium (webdriver).
Interact with web elements (e.g., clicks, typing, dragging) using ActionChains.
Locate elements on a webpage (By).
Handle key events (Keys).
Manage exceptions related to timeouts or missing elements.
Introduce delays (time.sleep) to wait for elements to load.
Store and manipulate data in a structured way (pandas).
Wait for specific conditions on the webpage to be met (WebDriverWait, expected_conditions).
These libraries and modules work together to automate web browsing tasks, commonly used in web scraping or browser automation.

#open the browser
driver_A=webdriver.Chrome()
Explanation: This creates a new instance of a Chrome browser using the Chrome driver from Selenium's webdriver module.
Details: webdriver.Chrome() launches the Chrome browser, which can now be controlled programmatically.
Driver: Make sure that you have the appropriate ChromeDriver executable installed and its path is correctly set in your environment variables, or you can specify the path directly.

#load the webpage
driver_A.get("https://www.redbus.in/online-booking/apsrtc/?utm_source=rtchometile")
Explanation: This command loads the specified URL (https://www.redbus.in/online-booking/apsrtc/?utm_source=rtchometile) in the browser.
Details: The get() method opens the webpage in the browser instance and waits until the page is completely loaded.

time.sleep(3)
Explanation: This introduces a delay of 3 seconds in the script after the page has loaded.
Details: time.sleep(3) pauses the execution for 3 seconds, which can be useful if you need to wait for elements to load on the page before performing any actions. However, it's usually better to use explicit waits (e.g., WebDriverWait) instead of time.sleep() to wait for specific conditions, as it makes the script more efficient.

4. driver_A.maximize_window()
Explanation: This maximizes the browser window to full-screen.
Details: This ensures the browser window is not in a minimized or small state and is fully visible on your screen. It can be useful when interacting with elements that may be hidden or inaccessible in smaller windows.
